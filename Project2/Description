Project-2 : Adversarial Search

Introduction :

In this project, you will write a program to determine the minimax value for given
positions of the Reversi game, using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm with positional
weight evaluation functions.


File Formats
Input format:
<player to move>
<search cut-off depth>
<current board status>
where the board status is denoted by * as blank cell, X as black piece, and O as white piece.


Output format:
<next state>
<traverse log>
where the traverse log requires 5 columns. Each column is separated by “,”. The five
columns are node, depth, minimax value, alpha, beta.
